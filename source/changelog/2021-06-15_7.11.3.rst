Added
-----

- Support for the `editheader` capability for *Sieve*.
- PHP's `phpize` to the `$PATH`.

Changed
-------

- *Dovecot* now ignores a size mismatch between the mail file on disk and the
  size given in its filename. This should prevent errors, occurring when
  something changes the mail after it was delivered (e.g. writing an extra
  header to it, like *CRM114*).
